<h1>My projects</h1><br>
I have created several projects over the years, so here's the ones I am most proud of. Many of these focus on researching and documenting rather niche, nerdy topics, but ultimately I feel I have done a lot of good things for them. Another reason I tend to work on more niche projects is because I like to "fill in the gaps"; documenting stuff no one else has bothered to do before.<br><br>

<h2>Ringtone Bangers</h2><br>
I run a Twitter account called Ringtone Bangers, which posts two great ringtones a day and one piece of tech-related music a week. I created this as I feel many ringtones are underappreciated and are legitimately good pieces of music, rather than just being "good for a ringtone". The account has managed to gain a large cult following of over 20K+ followers, with several ringtones gaining thousands of likes. If this account sounds like your cup of tea, go follow it!<br><br>
<a class="twitter-timeline" data-width="300" data-height="400" data-theme="dark" href="https://twitter.com/ringtonebangers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Tweets by ringtonebangers</a> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br><br> 
<a href="https://twitter.com/ringtonebangers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @ringtonebangers</a><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br><br>
Asides from running that account, I am legitimately interested in ringtones and who made them/how they were made. I am working on a few spreadsheets documenting ringtones, and contacting original composers for more information.<br><br>
<h2>Wallpaper projects</h2><br>
I have also created many projects related to Windows wallpapers, which was a hyperfixation of mine for a few years. These include: packs featuring higher resolution versions of wallpapers, a wiki dedicated to this subject, and a spreadsheet where I document my finds. I feel I have excelled with my work as I have been able to spread high resolution wallpapers and previously undiscovered information.<br><br>

</ul><br>
There's also another wallpaper project in the works, it's a surp- nah. I'm currently working on a large pack of every last official Windows wallpaper I can find. I am taking my time with this pack, so that I can get it as complete as possible. Stay tuned!
